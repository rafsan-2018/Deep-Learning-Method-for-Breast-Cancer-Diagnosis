Breast Cancer Segmentation Using UNET and Attention UNET

Project Overview
This project develops deep learning models for segmenting breast cancer in ultrasound images using UNET and Attention UNET architectures. The goal is to identify benign and malignant tumors to improve early diagnosis. The dataset used is the Breast Ultrasound Images dataset from Kaggle (2020).

Model Architecture
1. UNET Model
UNET is a CNN-based model for image segmentation, using an encoder-decoder structure to capture both spatial and semantic information, producing binary masks that segment tumor regions.

2. Attention UNET Model
This model enhances UNET with attention mechanisms, helping focus on key image regions. This improves segmentation accuracy, especially for small or hard-to-detect tumors.

3. Grad-CAM for Explainability
Grad-CAM generates visual heatmaps to highlight areas that influenced the modelâ€™s predictions, improving transparency and aiding clinical interpretation.

Dataset
Source: Breast Ultrasound Images (Kaggle, 2020).
Images: 780 PNG images, categorized as normal, benign, and malignant.
Split: 70% training, 20% validation, 10% test.
Data Preprocessing
Mask Combination: Benign and malignant tumor masks are merged for each image.
Data Augmentation:
Resizing: 256x256 pixels
Rotation, flipping, zooming, and shearing to increase variability.
